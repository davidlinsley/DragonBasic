       TTL    DLOAD - Load program from host computer.

*
* DLOAD[<filename>[,<baud rate select>]]
* DLOADM[<filename>[,[<baud rate select>][,<load offset>]]]
*

       XDEF   DLOAD
DLOAD  JSR    CLSCAS   Close the cassette since DLOAD uses
*    the cassette buffer and other temps.
       CLR    ,-S      Say it isn't DLOADM.
       JSR    CHRGOT   Refetch since CLSCAS destroyed A.
       CMPA   #'M      Is it DLOADM?
       BNE    NTDLDM   No.
       STA    ,S       Yes, remeber that it is.
       JSR    CHRGET   Skip over the "M".
NTDLDM JSR    GETFLN   Scan the filename into FILNAM.
       JSR    CHRGOT   End of the statement?
       BEQ    OLDBR    Yes, use the old baud rate.
       JSR    CHKCOM   No, skip a comma.
       CMPA   #COMMA   Use the old baud rate?
       BEQ    OLDBR    Yes.
       JSR    GETBYT   No, evaluate the baud rate arg.
       JSR    STBAUD   Call the baud rate select routine.
       LBCS   FCERR    Bad argument, give FC error.
OLDBR  JSR    OPNHST   Open the file on the host and load
*    the cassette buffer.
       PSHS   A        Save the file type byte.
       LDA    #-&3     Set DEVNUM so chars come from the
       STA    DEVNUM   host file.
       PULS   A        Retrieve the file type.
       TST    ,S+      Test and get rid of the DLOADM flag.
       BNE    DLOADM   Go handle DLOADM.
       JSR    TRMCHK   For DLOAD, the statement must end now.
       TSTB            Is it an ASCII file?
       BEQ    BADMOD   No, can't load it.
       JSR    SCRTCH   Yes, get rid of the old program.
       JMP    MAIN     Main does the rest.

BADMOD JMP    FMERR    Give a file mode error.
*    Eventually the host will figure out
*    that we have given up.

*
* The CLOAD code comes here so we can grab CLOADM to handle
* assembler object code files which have the same format as
* DLOADM files.
*

       XDEF   CLOADM
CLOADM CLR    CASOPN   Yes, force the cassette closed.
*    (Don't force out buffer to be
*    consistent with 8K ROM.  See comments
*    regarding this in 8K CLOAD code.)
       JSR    CHRGET   Skip over the "M".
       JSR    GETFLN   Scan the filename.
       JSR    OPNCSI   Open the cassette for input.
       TST    GAPFLG   Is it a gapped file?
       LBEQ   MLDUNG   No, let 8K ROM handle.
       LDU    FILTYP   Yes, save the FILTYP and ASCFLG in
*    in U since LODBUF will overwrite
*    them.  (LODBUF doesn't affect U.)
       DEC    DEVNUM   Set DEVNUM to -1 for cassette.  (It
*    is OK to assume that DEVNUM is zero
*    since it is guaranteed to be zero
*    at the start of each statement.)
       JSR    LODBUF   Load the cassette buffer.
       TFR    U,D      A:=FILTYP, B:=ASCFLG.
DLOADM SUBD   #&2*&256 Must be a binary machine language
*    file.
       BNE    BADMOD   Give file mode error if not.
       LDX    DBLZER   Assume no load offset given.
       JSR    CHRGOT   Is there one?
       BEQ    OFFNO    No.
       JSR    CHKCOM   Yes, skip the comma and evaluate
       JSR    EVLADR   the load offset into X.
OFFNO  STX    LODOFF   Save the load offset.
       JSR    TRMCHK   The statement must end now.
LODMRC BSR    NXTCHR   Get and save the record type byte.
       PSHS   A
       BSR    LOD2M    Read the record length into D.
       TFR    D,Y      Move byte count to Y.
       BSR    LOD2M    D:=load or execution address,
       ADDD   LODOFF   Add in the offset.
       STD    EXECAD   Store it for the EXEC statement.
       TFR    D,X      Put load address into X.
       LDA    ,S+      Is this a data record?
       LBNE   CLOSIT   No, close the file and return.
LODMLP BSR    NXTCHR   Get a byte of the program.
       STA    ,X       Store it.
       CMPA   ,X+      Did it store OK?
       BNE    GOIOER   No, give I/O error.
       LEAY   -&1,Y    Yes, more to read?
       BNE    LODMLP   Yes, read the next byte.
       BRA    LODMRC   No, go handle the next record.

LOD2M BSR     LOD1M    D:=next two bytes from tape.
LOD1M BSR     NXTCHR
       EXG    A,B
