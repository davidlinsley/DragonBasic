# Contributor Guidance

The intent of this repo is for the historical archival of the Microsoft 6809 BASIC source code and listing, and Pull Requests will be accepted for corrections of the OCR to further fidelity. If you wish to submit a correction please update the corresponding files in both the listing and src directories. Corrections to the ocr directory files are optional but welcome. Scripts for automating verification and correction of the OCR would also be welcome. Please create a scripts folder in the root directory of the repo if one does not yet exist.
