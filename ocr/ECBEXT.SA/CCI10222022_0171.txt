PAGE  022  ECBEXT  .SA:1  EXTEND RENUM - Renumber a BASIC program

02049                      *  1
02050                      *  High byte of binary line number
02051                      *  Low byte of binary line number
02052                      *  Unused
02053                      *  Unused
02054                      *
02055                      * 8) Scan the program looking for binary line number tokens and
02056                      * undefined line reference tokens. When an undefined line
02057                      * reference token is found print the message "Undefined
02058                      * Line XXXXX In YYYYY" where "XXXXX" is the undefined line
02059                      * number and "YYYYY" is the line number (after renumbering)
02050                      * of the line the reference is in.
02061                      *
02062                      * Convert all undefined line reference and binary line number
02063                      * tokens to ASCII by calling FOUT.  Put the ASCII digits
02064                      * into the space used by the token and block transfer the
02055                      * program down if there is space left over.  (This is the
02066                      * case if the ASCII representation is fewer than 5 digits.
02067                      * The ASCII can never be longer than 5 digits so block
02068                      * transferring up is never required at this point.)
02069                      *
02070                      * 9) Step 8 destroyed the links if any block transferring occurred
02071                      * so call CHEAD to fix them up.
02072                      *
02073                      * 10) Call CLEARC to init ARYTAB and STREND to point
02074                      * to the new end of program.  Jump to READY.
